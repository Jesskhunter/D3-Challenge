# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3
 
## The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau, but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. 

## Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directory—make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.

Include state abbreviations in the circles.

Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

## Bonus-

-More Data, More Dynamics
Include more demographics and more risk factors. Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. Do this for two risk factors for each axis. Or, for an extreme challenge, create three for each axis.
