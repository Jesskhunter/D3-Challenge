          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Obesity: Overall obesity seems to be significantly higher where median income levels are lower. We see a similar pattern with poverty. Obesity is higher where median age is between 34 through 45.
          <br>Smokers: Smoking trends show a similar pattern. States with lower median income and higher poverty rates have a larger percentage of smokers. Kentucky and West Virginia have an unusaully higher percentage of smokers.
          <br>Lack of Healthcare: Around 15% of the population in the US do not have healthcare, however, poverty and median income do not seem to have a direct corrrelation to lack of healthcare. Texas, which is not an impoverished state, and has a median income of $50K, has a significantly high percentage (24.9%) of uninsured people.
